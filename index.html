                <p>The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the  <br> Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the world's most recognizable landmarks. <br>

                    Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu) <br>, Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx,<br>  are usually top of most <br>  visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight  <br> they head to after landing.
                    
                    Today, sitting on the desert edge of Cairo's sprawl, <br>  these megalithic  <br> memorials to dead pharaohs are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight of any Egypt trip.</p>

                2. Luxor's Temples & Tombs</h3>
                <p>Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions.

                    This is ancient Thebes, power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one visit.
                    Luxor's east bank is home the modern city, with its vibrant souq; the two temples of Karnak and Luxor; and the museum. The west bank's lush farmland and barren cliffs are where the vast majority of Luxor's tourist attractions sit, with so many tomb and temple sights that it has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world.
                    
                    Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and gazing in awe at the colossal columns in the temples, and you'll see why Luxor continues to</p>

                <p  style="size: 20px;">Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors, a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.

                    Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.</p>

                <p>Even in a country festooned with temples, Abu Simbel is something special. <br> This is Ramses II's great temple, adorned with colossal statuary standing guard outside, and with an interior sumptuously decorated with wall paintings. <br>

                    Justly famous for its megalithic proportions, Abu Simbel is also known for the incredible  <br> engineering  feat carried out by UNESCO in the 1960s, which saw the entire temple moved from its original setting to save it from disappearing under the rising water of the Aswan dam.
                    
                    Today, exploring Abu Simbel is just as much about admiring the triumph of this international effort to save the temple complex as it is about gaping in wonder at Ramses II's awe-inspiring building works, itself.</p>

                <p>A treasure trove of the Pharaonic world, Cairo's Egyptian Museum is one of the world's great museum collections. The faded pink mansion in downtown Cairo is home to a dazzling amount of exhibits.

                    It's a higgledy-piggledy place, with little labeling on offer and chronological order severely lacking. Instead every corner you turn here is home to some wonderful piece of ancient art or statuary, which would be the highlight of any other museum.

                <p>Egypt's kookiest natural wonder is White Desert National Park, <br>  out in the Western Desert, just south of Bahariya Oasis. Here, surreally shaped chalk pinnacles and huge boulders loom over the desert plateau, creating a scene that looks like icebergs have found themselves stranded amid a landscape of sand. <br>

                    This highly scenic environment looks like something out of a science fiction movie and is a favorite destination for 4WD desert trips and overnight camping, which are both easiest organized in Bahariya Oasis.</p>
